This is just a collection of some exercises and solutions from the second edition of the
book `How to design programs 2e`_. 

These are just my solutions and are by no means the right way to solve them. And sometimes
I added things that were not asked for.

Images have been taken from `OpenClipart-Vectors`_ , kudos to him/her/them.
